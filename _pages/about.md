I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UCSD. I am a research assistant at the [System Energy Efficiency Lab (SeeLab)](http://varys.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD, supervised by Professor Tajana Rosing. 

My research broadly covers mobile computing and embedded intelligence, with a particular interest in batteryless and intermittent computing and sustainable computing. Additionally, my research interests also relate to wireless technologies and edge speech/audio processing and applications. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, supervised by [Professor Shahriar Nirjon](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~nirjon/). 

You may find my [CV](https://leonardz.me/assets/pdf/Le-Zhang-CV.pdf) and [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/lezhangleonard) here.
