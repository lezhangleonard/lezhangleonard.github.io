I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UCSD. I am a research assistant at [System Energy Efficiency Lab (SeeLab)](https://varys.ucsd.edu/) at UCSD, supervised by Professor Tajana Rosing. My research focuses on Mobile Computing and Embedded Intelligence, with a particular interest in Batteryless and Intermittent Computing. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, supervised by Professor Shahriar Nirjon.
